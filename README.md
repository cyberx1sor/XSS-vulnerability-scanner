# XSS-vulnerability-scanner
XSS vulnerability scanner is a Python program that helps identify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It scans web pages within a given URL and its subdirectories, and performs security checks on input fields and textareas.

The program uses predefined payloads to check for potential XSS vulnerabilities in the user-controllable input fields. It identifies and highlights any vulnerable fields, providing information to the user about the potential security risks.

## Features

- Scans web pages for input fields of type "text" and textareas.
- Performs XSS security checks using predefined payloads.
- Identifies and marks vulnerable fields as "Vulnerable" or "Secure".
- Supports scanning of web pages within the root directory and its subdirectories.
- Provides information about the URL being scanned and the status of each field.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library: `pip install requests`
- colorama library: `pip install colorama`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `webvuln.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `webvuln.py` file is located.
3. Install the required libraries if not already installed
4. Run the program: 

Windows: `python webvuln.py` 

Linux: `python3 webvuln.py`

5. Enter the URL when prompted. (must include https:// or http:// at the beginning) For example:

`Enter a URL: https://prompt.ml`

6. The program will start scanning the web pages within the provided URL and its subdirectories. It will perform XSS security checks on input fields of type "text" and textareas.
7. The program will display the status of each field, indicating whether it is "Vulnerable" or "Secure". Vulnerable fields will be highlighted in red.
8. The program will continue scanning internal links within the website until all relevant pages have been checked.

## Notes

- This program performs basic XSS security checks and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities. It serves as a starting point for identifying and securing potential XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

- It is recommended to complement this program with other security practices such as input validation, output encoding, and following secure coding guidelines to ensure robust protection against XSS attacks.

- The program focuses on input fields of type "text" and textareas by default. If you want to expand the security checks to other HTML elements, you can modify the code accordingly.
